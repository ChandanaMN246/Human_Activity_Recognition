# Human_Activity_Recognition

This project is a Python implementation of a machine learning model for human activity recognition using data from smartphones. The goal of the project is to classify the type of physical activity performed by a person based on the sensor data collected from their smartphone, including accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.

The project includes features such as preprocessing the raw sensor data to extract features, training a machine learning model to classify the activities, and evaluating the performance of the model using cross-validation techniques. The data used for the project is the publicly available Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset from kaggle.

The program uses popular Python libraries for machine learning, such as scikit-learn and pandas, to implement the model pipeline.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques in Python for activity recognition using sensor data from smartphones. It can be useful for researchers, developers, and data scientists interested in human activity recognition, and can be easily extended to other datasets or applications.
